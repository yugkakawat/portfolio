Yug_Kakawat_Portfolio
=====================

This folder contains an animated, professional portfolio website for **Yug Kakawat** (CYSE 3rd year).

Files:
- index.html — main single-page portfolio with animated hero, about, projects, and contact.
- articles.html — simple articles listing page.
- styles.css — styles (dark, glass look).
- script.js — JS for animations (uses GSAP and Typed.js from CDNs).
- avatar.png — placeholder avatar image.
- README.md — this file.

How to run (locally):
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click). For full CDN assets, you need an internet connection.
3. If you want to serve it via a simple static server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server` then open http://localhost:8000

Customize:
- Replace avatar.png with your photo (keep name `avatar.png`).
- Edit index.html to add/replace projects, articles, or links.
- All external links already point to your GitHub and LinkedIn.

Notes:
- Animations use CDN-hosted GSAP and Typed.js for smooth effects.
- This project is intentionally lightweight and easy to run locally.
